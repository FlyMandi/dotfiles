Dotfiles are a hell of a useful thing to back up, don't you think?

Remember kids, make your config files cross-platform and cross-hardware, so that you can be up and running with your favourite settings in no time.

This repo will inevitably be most useful to myself, but I guess I'll add sample pictures and stuff later so you can copy any config of mine you fancy. (You can still do that, but you just don't have any previews. Funny, that.)

For immediate and automated setup, I simply run 
```pwsh
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flymandi/pwsh-collection/master/scripts/push-configs.ps1 | iex
```
